===========================================================================

:Author: OpenWrt Community
:Date: |today|
:Version: 8.3.0

Overview
========

The OpenWrt Kernel Patch Management Tools is a comprehensive suite designed 
for managing kernel patches in OpenWrt development environments. The suite 
consists of two main components:

1. **kernel_snapshot_tool** - High-precision file change detection tool
2. **quilt_patch_manager_final.sh** - Integrated patch management script

These tools provide Git-like functionality for tracking file changes, 
automated patch creation, CVE vulnerability analysis, and seamless 
integration with the quilt patch management system.

Technical Principles
====================

Snapshot Engine
---------------

The kernel_snapshot_tool implements a Git-inspired architecture with the 
following key features:

**Zero File Loss Design**:
- Single-threaded directory traversal ensures complete file discovery
- Multi-threaded content processing for performance
- Comprehensive symbolic link handling

**Git-Compatible Behavior**:
- Content-based change detection using SHA256/SHA1 hashing
- Index cache for fast status checks (similar to Git's .git/index)
- Proper symbolic link handling (records symlink itself, not target)

**Cross-Platform Support**:
- macOS: Uses _NSGetExecutablePath() for executable path detection
- Linux: Uses /proc/self/exe for accurate path resolution
- Automatic CPU core detection for optimal thread count

File Change Detection Algorithm
-------------------------------

The change detection follows this workflow::

    1. Baseline Creation:
       - Scan directory tree recursively
       - Calculate content hash for each file
       - Store metadata (size, mtime, permissions)
       - Build index cache for fast lookups

    2. Change Detection:
       - Quick check: Compare mtime and size
       - If changed: Recalculate content hash
       - Compare hashes for definitive change detection
       - Classify as: Added (A), Modified (M), Deleted (D)

    3. Performance Optimization:
       - Hash table for O(1) file lookups
       - Skip hash calculation when mtime/size unchanged
       - Parallel processing for CPU-intensive operations

Patch Management Workflow
==========================

The integrated workflow supports two primary use cases:

Traditional Quilt Workflow
---------------------------

1. **Patch Analysis**::

    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh test-patch <commit-id|file|url>

   - Downloads patch from various sources (commit ID, local file, URL)
   - Performs dry-run testing against target kernel
   - Generates intelligent conflict analysis reports
   - Checks for file conflicts with existing patches

2. **File Extraction**::

    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh extract-files <patch-source>
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh extract-metadata <patch-source>

   - Extracts affected file lists for quilt add operations
   - Preserves original patch metadata for CVE patches
   - Outputs structured data for automated processing

3. **Patch Creation**::

    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh create-patch <patch-name>
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh add-files <file-list>
    # Manual code modification
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh refresh-with-header <metadata-source>

   - Creates empty quilt patch
   - Adds files to patch tracking
   - Generates final patch with original authorship information

Snapshot-Based Workflow
------------------------

1. **Baseline Creation**::

    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh snapshot-create [directory]

   - Creates comprehensive file state snapshot
   - Builds index cache for fast change detection
   - Supports automatic directory detection via global config

2. **Code Modification**::

    # Modify kernel source files...
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh snapshot-status

   - Real-time change monitoring
   - Git-like status output with precise change classification

3. **Change Analysis**::

    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh snapshot-list-changes > changed_files.txt
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh export-changed-files

   - Exports complete change set maintaining directory structure
   - Generates quilt-compatible file lists
   - Preserves file relationships for complex patches

Command Reference
=================

kernel_snapshot_tool Commands
------------------------------

**Core Operations**

``create [target_directory] [project_name]``
    Create baseline snapshot in specified or configured directory.
    
    Options:
      -t, --threads=N    Use N threads for processing (default: CPU cores)
      -v, --verbose      Enable detailed output
      -g, --git-hash     Use Git-compatible SHA1 instead of SHA256
      -e, --exclude=PAT  Exclude files matching pattern

    Examples::
    
        # Create in current directory
        kernel_snapshot_tool create
        
        # Create in specific directory
        kernel_snapshot_tool create /path/to/kernel linux-6.6
        
        # With custom options
        kernel_snapshot_tool create -t 8 -v --git-hash

``status``
    Check workspace status against baseline snapshot.
    
    Outputs Git-style change indicators:
      - A: Added files
      - M: Modified files  
      - D: Deleted files
      
    Uses index cache for performance (~100x faster than full scan).

``list-changes``
    Output all changed file paths (new + modified) in plain text format.
    Optimized for script processing and quilt integration.

``list-new``
    Output only newly added file paths.

``list-modified``  
    Output only modified file paths.

``clean [force]``
    Remove snapshot data from configured workspace.
    
    - Without 'force': Interactive confirmation required
    - With 'force': Silent cleanup

``diff <old_snapshot> <new_snapshot>``
    Compare two snapshot files and show differences.

**Configuration**

Global configuration file: ``.kernel_snapshot.conf``

Location priority:
  1. Tool directory (recommended)
  2. Current working directory  
  3. User home directory

Format::

    # Default workspace directory (absolute path)
    default_workspace_dir=/path/to/kernel/source
    
    # Default project name
    default_project_name=kernel-project
    
    # Ignore patterns (comma-separated)
    ignore_patterns=.git,.svn,*.tmp,*.log,*.bak,*.o,*.ko

**Ignore Patterns**

Supported patterns:
  - ``*.tmp, *.log`` - Suffix matching
  - ``temp_*`` - Prefix matching
  - ``.git, node_modules`` - Exact matching
  - Directory names automatically exclude entire subtrees
