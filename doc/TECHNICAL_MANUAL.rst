===========================================================================

:Author: OpenWrt Community
:Date: |today|
:Version: 8.8.0

Overview
========

The OpenWrt Kernel Patch Management Tools is a comprehensive suite designed 
for managing kernel patches in OpenWrt development environments. The suite 
consists of two main components:

1. **kernel_snapshot_tool** - High-precision file change detection tool
2. **quilt_patch_manager_final.sh** - Integrated patch management script

v8.4.0 builds on v8.3 with **File List Export Functionality**, providing a more flexible file management system:

**New Features (v8.4.0)**:
- **File List Export**: New ``export-from-file`` command supports exporting files based on specified file lists
- **Global Configuration Integration**: Automatically reads ``default_workspace_dir`` from global configuration files as root directory
- **Session Management System**: Creates independent timestamped session directories for each export
- **Comment Support**: File lists support comment lines and blank lines for improved maintainability

These tools provide Git-like functionality for tracking file changes, 
automated patch creation, CVE vulnerability analysis, file list export,
and seamless integration with the quilt patch management system.

Architecture
============

Component Structure::

    ├── kernel_snapshot_tool/           # Core snapshot engine
    │   ├── main.c                     # Command dispatcher
    │   ├── snapshot_core.c            # File scanning and hashing

    └── quilt_patch_manager_final.sh   # High-level workflow manager

Technical Principles
====================

Snapshot Engine
---------------

The kernel_snapshot_tool implements a Git-inspired architecture with the 
following key features:

**Zero File Loss Design**:
- Single-threaded directory traversal ensures complete file discovery
- Multi-threaded content processing for performance
- Comprehensive symbolic link handling

**Git-Compatible Behavior**:
- Content-based change detection using SHA256/SHA1 hashing
- Index cache for fast status checks (similar to Git's .git/index)
- Proper symbolic link handling (records symlink itself, not target)

**Cross-Platform Support**:
- macOS: Uses _NSGetExecutablePath() for executable path detection
- Linux: Uses /proc/self/exe for accurate path resolution
- Automatic CPU core detection for optimal thread count

File Change Detection Algorithm
-------------------------------

The change detection follows this workflow::

    1. Baseline Creation:
       - Scan directory tree recursively
       - Calculate content hash for each file
       - Store metadata (size, mtime, permissions)
       - Build index cache for fast lookups

    2. Change Detection:
       - Quick check: Compare mtime and size
       - If changed: Recalculate content hash
       - Compare hashes for definitive change detection
       - Classify as: Added (A), Modified (M), Deleted (D)

    3. Performance Optimization:
       - Hash table for O(1) file lookups
       - Skip hash calculation when mtime/size unchanged
       - Parallel processing for CPU-intensive operations

Patch Management Workflow
==========================

The integrated workflow supports two primary use cases:

Traditional Quilt Workflow
---------------------------

1. **Patch Analysis**::

    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh test-patch <commit-id|file|url>

   - Downloads patch from various sources (commit ID, local file, URL)
   - Performs dry-run testing against target kernel
   - Generates intelligent conflict analysis reports
   - Checks for file conflicts with existing patches

2. **File Extraction**::

    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh extract-files <patch-source>
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh extract-metadata <patch-source>

   - Extracts affected file lists for quilt add operations
   - Preserves original patch metadata for CVE patches
   - Outputs structured data for automated processing

3. **Patch Creation**::

    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh create-patch <patch-name>
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh add-files <file-list>
    # Manual code modification
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh refresh-with-header <metadata-source>

   - Creates empty quilt patch
   - Adds files to patch tracking
   - Generates final patch with original authorship information

Snapshot-Based Workflow
------------------------

1. **Baseline Creation**::

    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh snapshot-create [directory]

   - Creates comprehensive file state snapshot
   - Builds index cache for fast change detection
   - Supports automatic directory detection via global config

2. **Code Modification**::

    # Modify kernel source files...
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh snapshot-status

   - Real-time change monitoring
   - Git-like status output with precise change classification

3. **Change Analysis**::

    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh snapshot-list-changes > changed_files.txt
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh export-changed-files

   - Exports complete change set maintaining directory structure
   - Generates quilt-compatible file lists
   - Preserves file relationships for complex patches

File List Export Workflow (v8.4.0 New)
----------------------------------------

1. **File List Preparation**::

    # Create file list
    cat > target_files.txt << EOF
    # Kernel core files
    Makefile
    kernel/sched/core.c
    include/linux/sched.h
    drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000/e1000_main.c
    
    # Comment lines and blank lines are automatically ignored
    fs/ext4/file.c
    mm/memory.c
    EOF

2. **File Export Execution**::

    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh export-from-file target_files.txt

   - Automatically reads ``default_workspace_dir`` from global configuration
   - Exports files maintaining original relative path structure
   - Creates independent timestamped session directories

3. **Export Result Analysis**::

    # Export directory structure
    patch_manager_work/outputs/exported_files/
    ├── export_20250113_153045/        # Timestamped session directory
    │   ├── kernel_dir_name/           # Kernel files directory
    │   │   ├── Makefile
    │   │   ├── kernel/sched/core.c
    │   │   └── include/linux/sched.h
    │   ├── EXPORT_INDEX.txt           # Detailed export report
    │   └── successful_files.txt       # Successful files list
    └── latest -> export_20250113_153045  # Latest export soft link

   - ``EXPORT_INDEX.txt`` contains complete export statistics and failure reasons
   - ``successful_files.txt`` facilitates subsequent batch processing
   - ``latest`` soft link provides quick access to the latest export result

**Technical Features**:

- **Global Configuration Integration**: Automatically reads ``default_workspace_dir`` from ``.kernel_snapshot.conf``
- **Comment Support**: File lists support ``#`` comment lines for improved readability and maintainability
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles non-existent files with detailed failure reasons and suggestions
- **Session Management**: Creates independent timestamped export sessions to avoid overwriting historical data
- **Directory Structure Preservation**: Completely maintains original relative paths, ensuring file organization relationships remain intact

Patch Editing Operations
========================

fold - Merge External Patches
-----------------------------

The ``fold`` command is used to merge the contents of external patch files into the current top patch.

**Syntax**::

    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh fold <patch-file>

**Usage Examples**::

    # Merge externally downloaded patch
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh fold external-cve-fix.patch
    
    # Merge multiple patches into current patch
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh fold patch1.patch
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh fold patch2.patch

**Use Cases**:

- Integrate CVE fix patches downloaded from the internet
- Merge patch files provided by colleagues
- Combine multiple small patches into one large patch

**Important Notes**:

- Must have a current top patch before use
- External patch format needs to be compatible
- May require manual conflict resolution

header - Patch Header Information Management
-------------------------------------------

The ``header`` command is used to view and edit patch header information (metadata).

**Syntax**::

    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh header [options] [patch-name]

**Options**:

- ``-e``: Edit header information using an editor
- ``-a``: Append content to header
- ``-r``: Replace header content

**Usage Examples**::

    # View current patch header information
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh header
    
    # View specified patch header information
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh header platform/cve-fix.patch
    
    # Edit current patch header
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh header -e
    
    # Append signature information
    echo "Signed-off-by: Your Name <email@example.com>" | ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh header -a
    
    # Replace header information from file
    ./quilt_patch_manager_final.sh header -r < new-description.txt

**Use Cases**:

- Add detailed descriptions and author information to patches
- Correct incorrect information in patches
- Add standard metadata like Signed-off-by
- Update patch versions and modification records
